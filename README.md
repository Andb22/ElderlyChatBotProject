The brief-
  To design and build an app which is aimed at assisting older people that may be suffering from memory difficulties. 
  The app should be able to do the following tasks-
  - act as a memory aid for daily tasks and appointments
  - be an easy to access store of memorable images for the user
  - store and allow easy access to personal contact details
  - be a source of daily mental stimulation. 
  
    The app needs to be as easy to access and simple as possible while still retaining goo aesthetics.
